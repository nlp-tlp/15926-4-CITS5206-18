## 1. Specifications and Requirements

### Functionality

- **Hierarchical Visualization**

The primary functionality required is to visualize the hierarchy of the Equipment RDL (Reference Data Library) from the ISO 15926-4 standard. The interactive hierarchy should allow users to expand and collapse different levels.

- **Data Processing**

The data processing involves extracting columns like UniqueName, SuperClass1, SuperClass2, SuperClass3, and SuperClass4 from appended files. This processed data forms the basis of the hierarchical visualisation.

### Performance

- **Efficient Data Rendering**

The system should handle large datasets efficiently, ensuring smooth interaction and quick response times.

### Compatibility

- **Cross-Platform**

The interface should be compatible across various browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and devices (desktops, tablets, smartphones).

### Security

- **No Password Access Needed**

Unlike the previous year's project, this one doesnâ€™t require password access, simplifying security requirements.

## 2. Design Preferences

### Design Styles

- **Clean and Modern**: A clean, minimalistic design with modern UI components is preferred. The use of colour coding can help differentiate different levels or categories within the hierarchy.

### Elements

- **Visual Elements**: Tree diagrams or collapsible lists are ideal for representing the hierarchy. Tooltips or information boxes should provide additional context on hover or click.

## 3. Additional Considerations

### Understanding the Hierarchy

- **Issues with Hierarchy**: There are issues with the current hierarchy, as highlighted in the ISO meeting presentation. Visualising the entire hierarchy, including specific parts, will aid in troubleshooting these issues.

- **Top-Level Nodes**: There are more top-level nodes than just 'Thing,' which requires careful consideration when designing the visualisation tool.

### Use Cases

- **Troubleshooting and Data Management**: The primary use cases include troubleshooting hierarchical issues and managing equipment data effectively.

## 4. Next Steps

- **Download Confirmation**: Ensure the data is successfully downloaded from the provided link. If not, please reach out for assistance.
- **Focus on Visualization**: Based on the ppt, focus on creating a clear and interactive way to visualise the hierarchy. Refer to the attempts on Slide 3 as a starting point but aim to enhance it significantly. (ISO15926-4_RDL_questions_for_CITS3200.pptx)
- **Web Hosting Setup**: Use the Namecheap account to purchase a domain name and set up the hosting environment for the final tool.
- **Further Discussions**: Schedule a meeting to discuss more details and refine the project scope, ensuring all requirements and preferences are adequately addressed.

## 5. Proposal Details

The provided proposal outlines the project aimed at creating a chatbot-like webpage for querying a document database, focusing on efficient information retrieval and robust security measures(CITS3200_MRIWA_proposal). While this proposal is not directly related to hierarchical visualisation, it offers insights into the team's capabilities and approach to project management.
