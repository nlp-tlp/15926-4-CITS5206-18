### **Agenda:**

2. **Output JSON Format:**
    - Discussed the required output fields: `uniqueName`, `superClass`, `subClass`, `definition`, and `type`.
    - Output to be generated using the Python script developed by Yu.
    - Sample dataset chosen for testing: **ACTUATOR** as the top node.
3. **Unique Name Matching Algorithm:**
