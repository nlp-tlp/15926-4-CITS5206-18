# Project Workflow Guide

This guide outlines our GitHub workflow from naming issues and creating branches to handling pull requests and merging code. Each step is designed to maintain code quality, encourage collaboration, and ensure a smooth development process.

## 1. Naming Issues

When creating an issue, follow these guidelines to ensure clarity and consistency.

### For Bug Reports:

- **"Fix [Specific Component] crash when [action]"**
  - Example: "Fix login page crash when submitting empty form"
  
- **"Incorrect [feature] behavior on [specific condition]"**
  - Example: "Incorrect search results behavior on special character input"
  
- **"Error when [action] with [specific input]"**
  - Example: "Error when uploading large files"

### For Feature Requests:

- **"Add support for [new feature]"**
  - Example: "Add support for dark mode theme"

- **"Implement [specific functionality] in [module/component]"**
  - Example: "Implement user authentication in login module"

- **"Enhance [feature] with [additional option]"**
  - Example: "Enhance file upload feature with progress bar"

### For Documentation:

- **"Update README with [specific instruction/clarification]"**
  - Example: "Update README with instructions for environment setup"

- **"Add documentation for [new feature]"**
  - Example: "Add documentation for OAuth2 integration"

- **"Correct [documentation page] for [specific error]"**
  - Example: "Correct API documentation for response format errors"

### For General Tasks:

- **"Refactor [specific component] for better [performance/readability]"**
  - Example: "Refactor API module for better error handling"

- **"Migrate [component/feature] to [new technology/version]"**
  - Example: "Migrate database layer to support PostgreSQL 13"

- **"Improve unit tests for [specific module]"**
  - Example: "Improve unit tests for the payment processing module"

## 2. Pull Request Workflow

A pull request (PR) is essential in team-based software development. It enables developers to collaborate, review changes, and ensure code quality before merging into the main codebase. This process improves communication, reduces the risk of bugs, and maintains the integrity of the project.

### Purpose of Pull Requests:

1. **Collaboration:** PRs allow peers to review, provide feedback, and suggest improvements.
2. **Quality Control:** PRs ensure that code adheres to project standards, passes tests, and integrates seamlessly with existing functionality.
3. **Version Control:** They track changes, providing transparency and a clear history of contributions.

### Process for Creating and Managing Pull Requests:

1. **Create a New Branch:**
   - Create a new branch for each issue or feature. This keeps the `main` branch stable.
   - Branch names should follow the format: `<issue-number>-<short-description>`.

2. **Develop and Test:**
   - Develop your changes on the branch and ensure thorough local testing before committing.
   
3. **Stage and Commit Changes:**
   - Use `git add` to stage your changes.
   - Use `git commit` to save your progress. Example commit message:
     ```
     Added plugin_check.py script, updated README and requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Push Changes to GitHub:**
   - Push the local branch to GitHub with:  
     `git push origin <branch_name>`

5. **Open a Pull Request:**
   - Open a PR on GitHub, and ensure the title clearly reflects the changes. Provide a detailed description explaining the purpose and changes made.
   - Example PR title:  
     *“Add plugin_check.py, update README, and fix dependencies”*

6. **Code Review:**
   - Team members will review your PR and provide feedback. Make any necessary changes based on the feedback received.

7. **Merge After Approval:**
   - Once the PR is approved by reviewers, it can be merged into the `main` branch.
   - Ensure that any merge conflicts are resolved, and the codebase remains stable.

By following these steps, we ensure that our development process is organized, collaborative, and results in high-quality code. This workflow maintains project stability and helps streamline our work.
